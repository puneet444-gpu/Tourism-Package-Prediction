#Tourism Package Prediction – MLOps Pipeline

## Business Problem
Visit with Us aims to predict whether a customer will purchase the newly introduced
Wellness Tourism Package before contacting them. Manual customer targeting is
inefficient and inconsistent.

This project implements an end-to-end MLOps pipeline to automate data preparation,
model training, evaluation, deployment, and CI/CD using GitHub Actions and Hugging Face.

## Objective
- Predict customer purchase behavior (`ProdTaken`)
- Automate ML lifecycle using MLOps best practices
- Enable scalable deployment and continuous updates

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- MLflow
- Hugging Face (Datasets, Model Hub, Spaces)
- Streamlit
- Docker
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
